My Private Book

Chapter 1: Personal Thoughts

This is a private book that only belongs to this specific user. It contains personal notes and thoughts that should not be accessible to other users.

The book listing system should now show this book as a "private" source when listing books for user test-user-123.

Chapter 2: Testing the System

This chapter is here to test that the reading system can properly:
1. List private books for specific users
2. Read content from user-specific private books
3. Search within user-specific private books

The system should maintain proper isolation between different users' private books.

Chapter 3: Conclusion

This private book demonstrates the user-specific book management functionality in the reading system.
